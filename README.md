# File System Simulation

This project is to demonstrate and understanding of a file systems by implementing a simulation of a file system using a text file.

The contents of the text file will include UFT-8 encoded plain text characters representing the data stored within the storage volume.

It's important to note that the storage device is 1 level abstracted from a real implementation of a file system since real file systems store their data encoded in binary.

Since encoding from UFT-8 to binary is relatively trival plain text will be used for the human readability purposes.
